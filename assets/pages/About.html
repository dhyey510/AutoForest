          <p>
            Our story begun in 2016, to be a meaningful part in Automobile
            Industry. Since the seeds of E-mobility were sowed globally to
            rehabilitate the world which is majorly affected by pollution from
            depletable resources, we started to make an effort worthy to be part
            of an era of Electric vehicles. We as AUTO FOREST, which reflects
            need to rescue forests by transmutation of source of energy to
            renewable one.<br /><br />In distribution, Auto Forest concentrates
            in promoting EV products through a wide number of its retail network
            across the country. EV parts that we deal in are made by
            professional International and Domestic manufacturer-partners, who
            are carefully supervising the product quality and development.<br /><br />
            Moreover, we are having an edge over other companies owing to our
            OEM facility as per which they are free to sell our spare parts
            under their own brand name.

          <p>
            The fact that world needs to change whole system of transportation
            because of high pollution emitting vehicles have already led to
            depletion of natural air and also to have transportation system
            majorly based on sustainable source of energy for future as compared
            to current non-renewable sources (i.e petrol, diesel etc). Our firm
            foresees personal growth because of high demand of E-vehicles
            together with helping world to save nature from destruction.
